Object recognition in video sequences is a complex yet critical task in the field of computer vision. This technology, which seamlessly interprets and understands dynamic visual information, mimics the human ability to identify and classify objects with high precision. Advancements in this area are vital for enhancing applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and innovative solutions in healthcare and public safety. This project aims to develop a robust computer vision system that effectively recognizes and categorizes objects within video sequences.
